# tradelib
A Java Framework for Backtesting and Trading

Tradelib has been used in real life, for backtesting and for signal
generation, for about a year now.

It has been mostly used for trading futures. Stocks and ETFs shouldn't
be a problem, but work is needed to support Forex, especially when
USD is not the quote currency.
